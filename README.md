This project is the "Vulnerability Assessment Tool", which uses the the concepts of Patch Recommendations, Deep Protocol Analysis, Brute  force simuation.
Main assessment function: The assess_vulnerabilities function is the core of the script. It takes the target IP, start port, and end port as input and performs the following steps:

Scans ports using TCP sockets to identify open ports.
For each open port, it grabs the banner, predicts vulnerability using the placeholder ML model, retrieves patch recommendations, performs basic protocol analysis, and simulates brute-force attacks (placeholder).
Maps the attack surface based on the identified services and ports.
Returns a dictionary containing the scan results.
Main execution: The main function prompts the user for the target IP, start port, and end port. It then calls the assess_vulnerabilities function to perform the scan and writes the results to a JSON file named "vulnerability_assessment_report.txt".
